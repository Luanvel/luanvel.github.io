            <p>
            This project is something I had in mind for a long time! During my time as a veterinarian, most people with exotic animals had real problems finding reliable and high-quality information, even more so in Spanish.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The majority of animals that came in sick were due to inadequate care due to lack of knowledge! And that's something I always tried to fix and help them with.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>With this app and website, I intend to create a very simple, easily accessible resource in Spanish to assist people in taking care of their companions in the best possible way!

            <p>Also, I decided to call it "Animales Exóticos y Cómo Cuidarlos" as a reference to "Animales Fantásticos y Dónde Encontrarlos" so it have a lot of engagement and it's easier to remember!!</p>

        <h2>Usability study: Findings</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>
            I conducted an <b>unmoderated usability study</b> remotely in Spain with a group of <b>five participants</b>. The study lasted for 5 to 10 minutes, during which each participant was asked to <b>look at Animal 2 information and add it to favorites as well as looking at the curiosity of the day</b>.
          </p>
          <p>In that study, it could be concluded that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In general, everyone was happy and could find the animal without problems, but they were confused because there was no real interaction with the heart that added to favorites.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>I changed that and did some motion for the high fidelity prototype that you will see next!</p>

            I created a placeholder <b>logo</b> until we decide to go live. I wanted to have colors like blue, yellow, orange and browns, as it reminds me of <b>wildlife</b>.</b>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>
            Throughout this project, I've been able to revisit all the steps to further solidify the foundations of user design.          </p>
          <br>
          <p>At the same time, I've been able to start shaping a project that I had in mind for a long time and that I hope will allow me to contribute my bit to those in need and make many animals have a better life!</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="use-case">
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>
            Now we will begin conducting more usability tests with the new finished prototype and start gathering information about all the animals to properly design the texts, all while we await updates on the new animal protection law in Spain.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>We will iterate during this time until we can launch the website and the app!</p>
          <br>
          <p>A point for the future would be to incorporate community features, as it was something that testers requested but we put on the back burner for later.</p>
          <br>
          <p><b>Thank you</b> for taking a look at this project! I hope that in the future, it can become a reality!</p>
