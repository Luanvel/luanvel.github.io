            This project is the result of my active engagement in the official Google UX Design Certificate program on Coursera, where I have strived to make the most of every opportunity presented by this project during its <b>two-month duration</b> as a <b>UX Designer.</b>

          <p>I decided to give it a twist from the first moment I started and I got down to work to do some small interviews to find out what <b>pain points</b> were repeated in people who decided to buy plants online while I made the competitive audit report.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The answer was clear: <b>little or nule information about the care and characteristics</b> and <b>little confidence not being able to see the plants you are going to buy</b>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Ah√°! that's it! In <b>this application</b>, we will <b>give information</b> about the plants and let the user <b>see a REAL photo</b> of the plant users are going to buy!</p>

          <p>At first, there wasn't a lateral bar, but I decided to add it for <b>accessibility</b>, as some people needs it to navigate through the app.</p>
          <p>Also, you couldn't select more that two plants at a time, and this bothered the users that tested the low fidelity prototype, so I added that option.</p>

        <h2>Usability study: Findings</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>
            I conducted an <b>unmoderated usability study</b> remotely in Spain with a group of <b>five participants</b>. The study lasted for 5 to 10 minutes, during which each participant was asked to <b>place an order for a plant and search for information</b>.
          </p>
          <p>In that study, it could be concluded that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>People with vision impairments could <b>need a navbar</b>, so we added it</li>
            <li>People <b>didn't want to return to homescreen after adding to cart</b>, so the screenflow was iterated and changed.</li>
            <li>People want to <b>be able to select more than one plant at a time</b>, so we added that option.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>All this changes are present in the digital wireframes that were shown before!</p>

          </div>
          <br>
          <p>
            In the process of designing the mockup, I created a <b>logo</b> to represent the brand's identity, with a particular focus on incorporating <b>shades of green</b> inspired by nature in all the app. Additionally, I ensured that the chosen color combinations provided the highest level of accessibility by <b>striving for triple A results in terms of color contrast.</b>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>
            Throughout this project, I have been able to acquire a <b>solid foundation in UX design</b> and have learned to use <b>FIGMA</b> effectively. Additionally, I have started to familiarize myself with <b>usability testing</b>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Overall, feedback from users who have seen the project and its evolution suggests that <b>incorporating real photographs would be a significant advancement for plant-selling</b> applications and websites. Many believe that if they order plants online, they may receive specimens that are undesirable or unpopular, which is why they prefer to make in-person purchases. Furthermore, these types of plants require <b>specific care instructions</b> that are not readily available, especially for users who are less tech-savvy.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="use-case">
        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>
            Ideally, it would be great to <b>conduct further usability testing</b> to determine if the identified pain points have been effectively addressed. Additionally, it would be beneficial to <b>incorporate a section with general plant care</b> for different types of plants, providing more specific details about their individual needs in the information section.
          </p>

          <p><b>Thank you</b> for joining me on this journey! I hope you found this application as interesting as I did!</p>
