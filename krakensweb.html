            <p>
              This design has been made for my personal project at <b>Kraken's Den Studios</b>, where I work as UI/UX Designer.
            </p>
            <p>In this project, I'm also working as part of the Front-End team. The web is actually in development using REACT.</p>

          <p>Kraken's Den Studios has started to grow! So we realised that a webpage is needed, so I started to sketch ideas and shared them with the team!</p>
          <br>
          <p>The "pet" for the company is a Kraken, and the turquoise was a must in this case! I opted for a elegant dark web, imitating the depths of the sea.</p>
          <br>
          <p>At first, I wanted to make a complex interface, in which you could enter a real Den and find the Kraken inside!! but I descarted the idea as it was difficult (almost impossible hehe) to do it in mobile phone!</p>

        <h2>Designing the Logo</h2>
        <div class="use-case-content">
          <p>Thanks to the guidance provided by LevelUp's mentoring, I have been able to refine the initial model, streamlining the design process and achieving balance between colors and fonts.</p>
          <p>Moreover, I made a deliberate choice to opt for a simpler and more legible font, ensuring that the logo maintains its clarity even when scaled down to smaller sizes.</p>

          <p>When we did the first tests, we realised that there was not enough call to action to our principal objective, subscribers!</p>
          <p>The model was a bit modified later on, and a button was added at the homepage, as well as in the lateral bar.</p>

            As I mentioned before, I wanted that the page felt like you were diving in the dephts of the oceans, while traveling through the Kraken's Den.
          </p>
          <p>The Individual page for the game itself, HeartWeaver, has a purplish and dark color palette, so I tried to mix the feel of the game with the overall look for the page!</p>
          <p>The distribution for the footer was also changed for increasing accessibility! The letters are now bigger and the privacy policy is difficult to miss!</p>

            Throughout this project, I have worked with Figma, Adobe Illustrator and Clip Studio Paint for illustrations. The web is <b>responsive</b> so I did two models, as there are different SVG's and icons for each variation.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The project was shared with other developers since the first steps, so i made sure that there won't be problems with coding!</p>

          <p>
            We are now building the web!
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>When the web is ready, we will proceed to do more testings and measure the level of engagement for the newsletter!</p>
